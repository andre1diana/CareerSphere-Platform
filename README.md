# üìÅ Code Structure

## Frontend

### public:
Contains images for the Dashboard gallery and index.html (default created with npm). The tab image has been customized.

### src:
Contains multiple folders:

1. **assets** ‚Äì Contains all images used in the project (logo, default profile picture, etc.)

2. **components** ‚Äì Contains all components displayed on the page based on user role, including RoutesComponent where all application routes are defined

3. **context** ‚Äì Files that save the application context in local storage to maintain functionalities such as login state and component display

4. **pages** ‚Äì All application pages

5. **styles** ‚Äì Contains styles used in pages

6. **App.js** ‚Äì The main component of the project containing contexts and routes to pages

## Backend

1. **config**  
Contains the configuration classes of the application:  
- `SecurityConfig`, `WebConfig`, `CorsConfig`, etc.  
- Settings for authentication, authorization (JWT), CORS, global mappings, etc.

2. **controller**  
Contains the `@RestController` classes:  
- Handles HTTP routes (e.g., `GET /api/users`, `POST /api/login`)  
- Connects the frontend with the application logic  
- Calls methods from the `service` layer

3. **database**  
Contains database-specific logic:  
- Data initialization files  
- DB connection/management classes (possibly `Flyway`, `Liquibase`)

4. **dto**  
DTO = Data Transfer Object:  
- Classes for transferring data between backend and frontend  
- Used to avoid exposing JPA entities directly  
- E.g., `UserDTO`, `JobDTO`, `LoginRequestDTO`

Contains filters applied to HTTP requests:  
- E.g., JWT filters (token-based authentication)

Contains JPA entities:  
- Maps database tables  
- E.g., `User`, `Job`, `Application`  
- Annotated with `@Entity`, `@Table`, etc.

7. **service**  
Contains the business logic of the application:  
- `@Service` classes implementing actual functionality  
- E.g., `UserService`, `AuthService`, `JobService`  
- Calls repositories and returns data to the controller

8. **util**  
Contains utility classes:  
- Helper functions: validations, conversions, hashing, etc.  
- E.g., `PasswordEncoderUtil`, `JwtUtil`, `DateUtils`

9. **BackendApplication.java**  
- The main class that runs the Spring Boot application  
- Annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`
